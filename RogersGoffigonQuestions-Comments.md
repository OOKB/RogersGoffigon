# Notes/Questions for May 30, 2013 Phonecall

The goal of approaching the project in the proposed manner is to try and make upkeep as simple and painless as possible.

So, of the list on page 6 of the most recent PDF, what is actually stored in the inventory system? — I already know that images are not, but what of the rest of that potential data can be mined directly from the existing system/structure?

Whatever isn't, we'll be building tools to as easily as possible do the rest…

I suppose though, there should be some base level of "if all it is able to do is update the price" maybe it isn't worth it?

On their end, the PHP/MySQL system, that either lives or syncs to the “Cloud”, how is that accessed or connected to?

company that built their system: [http://www.pdfsystems.com/]()

As for the images, we will be coming up with a solution for those, and the idea was that the main content creation act is uploading a new image and giving it the correct sku/item#. In a perfect scenario, most of the rest of the required information lives in the inv. management system and is merely pulled in. Depending on the actual case, then the other various categories, tags, etc. would be added to the image as some sort of Meta Data in the content creation phase.

## Questions about carousel/ filter functionality

Do we need to be able to select more then one filter at once?
Does the carousel still function when there is < 3 images?
Does the carousel show more/less then 3 images in the main window at different screen sizes?
